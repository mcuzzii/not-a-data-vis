  This module provides functionality for categorical data visualization and text
  mining capabilities. It features diverging stacked bar charts which are useful
  for ordinal data visualization. Text mining capabilities include sentiment
  analysis, word cloud generation, and frequencies of emotional phrases
  classified under anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise,
  and/or trust. 

  The sentiment analysis is based on the sentimentr package in R, which hosts a
  lexicon-based sentiment detection algorithm based on the Syuzhet lexicon. On
  one hand, emotions are detected based on the NRC Emotion Lexicon. These
  lexicons are also the basis of word cloud generation.
